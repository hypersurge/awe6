#summary Attempting to compare awe6 to alternative frameworks.

This comparison is work in progress, and the basis for much of this data is not yet fully researched!

It is intended to answer the question "What does awe6 do that X doesn't do?" (or vice versa), and not "Which framework is best for project Y?".  For practical deployments it is sometimes appropriate to combine frameworks (e.g. NME + awe6 + Flixel).

If you notice something to be incorrect on this page, or would like to help us complete this analysis, please let us know by adding a comment below.

 * L: Low-level Support (i.e. direct, no semantics)
 * A: Abstraction Layer (i.e. elaborate, expressed with context)
